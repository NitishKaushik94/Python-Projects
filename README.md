I am an Influencer Marketing Specialist with over 5 years of experience in digital strategy and campaign execution. 
I am currently transitioning into Data Analytics through a Professional Certificate Program in AI & Data Science from upGrad, in collaboration with PwC Academy.
The repositories you see here are a collection of real-world projects and technical experiments completed during my course. 
These aren't just academic exercises; they represent hands-on applications of Python, MySQL, and Advanced Excel to solve genuine business problems. 
My work focuses on bridging the gap between creative marketing and rigorous data analysis—specializing in:
Multi-format Data Orchestration: Managing complex e-commerce data across CSV, JSON, and TXT files.
Performance Analytics: Tracking ROI and campaign success metrics through structured reporting.
Data Validation: Building robust scripts that ensure data integrity and automated processing.
Each project serves as a milestone in my journey toward becoming a data-driven leader, turning raw information into strategic business growth.
